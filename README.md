Victoria: A Partial Evaluator for Maude

The partial evaluator Victoria is not fully implemented yet. Currently, its different modules are executed separately. You can find the Maude source code of the key components and dedicated checkers that we have developed for performing order-sorted equational specialization modulo axioms at http://safe-tools.dsic.upv.es/victoria/

Implemented by Angel Cuenca-Ortega Based on work by María Alpuente, Angel Cuenca-Ortega, Santiago Escobar and José Meseguer (C) 2016
